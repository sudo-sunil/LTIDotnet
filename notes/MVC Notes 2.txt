Security in ASP.NET MVC
authentication and authorization

authentication will check if the credentials are valid 
authorization will check if the user has premission to access the web page or not 

status code
200 OK - page is found and executed successfully
401-> - Unauthorized
403 - forbidden access- we are not authorized to view the page
404 - resource not found - when we are giving a wrong controller name/action method name
500 -> internal server error -> logic written in the action method w.r.t to EF is wrong

2 types of user for a web page
authenticated user and authorized to access the web page
Guest user. Anonymous access is allowed


Every Web page will have Home page and links to other pages from the Home page

Does Home page require authentication?
No it does not
we should use [AllowAnonymous] if authentication is not requires

If authentication is required then use [Authorize] before the ActionMethods

_ViewStart.cshtml is under Views Folder 
This file is referred by all the views (Child View) created using Add View in the controller methods

Layout view -> common header (menus) , footer which is defined in the Layout view

Layout View -> is a shared view which has common menu defined . All other view will access the layout view
It is defined in the Shared folder and it is named as _layout.cshtml which is pointed by the _viewstart.cshtml
@{
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
}

@RenderBody() -> this will display  the content of the other views between the common header and footer defined in layout page

Life cycle of MVC
Model ->Shape of data
validation , bind the fields to the view to take input/ show output
Deals with the business logic

View ->
User Interface
Interface layer between the model and controller

Routing ->(RouteConfig.cs)
Controller 
accept the incoming request
based on the request it will get the shape of data from model on which it has work (logic)
it will send a response as a view which is rendered on the browser
