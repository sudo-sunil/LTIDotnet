HTML and HTML 5 ->design static web page

CSS - cascading style sheet
it will have a common background color
common font size
common font type
foreground color
common menus
common footer


define the style once and apply to all the web pages

css is of 3 types
external css - styles are defined in a seperate file with .css extension
The styles are referred in the html file using <link>
internal css->we define the styles in the html file itself inside the <head> tag.
inline css-> we define style for the html tag itself using the style attribute

css styles have a unique syntax
body
{
background-color:yellow;
}
we can define style with a custom name instead of specific tag name
.<name> -> refer in html for any tag using class attribute
#<name>-> refer in html for any tag using id attribute

CSS3 is superset / extension of css where new styles are introduced
tag{
style:value;
style:value;
}

border
we can define a border,color of border, type of border and thickness of border surrounding any html tags

border type
dashed
dotted
groove
double 
solid 
rounded 

textshadow
it will create a shadow of the text
Mirror image of the text

box shadow
one side of the border will appear like a shadow
it will be like a 2 d effect of the div tag

both the type of shadow takes 4 parameters
horizontal shadow
vertical shadow
blur radius. if we dont give blur radius default value is 0px
shadow color

padding 
will give space left, right, top or bottom of a container element
padding : 14px 16px;
hover
when mouse is moved on any element 
div:hover
li a:hover
p:hover



css can convert a <ul> into a horizontal navigation menu or a vertical navigation menu
horizontal menu -> inline
li->it will remove the line break before and after each element , it will display them on one line

float ->li will appear either left to right , right to left
float : left or float: right

to convert ul to a horizontal menu , list-style-type :none


transformation

changing from one state to another state 
transformation can be applied by 2d or 3d on any html element
rotate -> rotate by a degree

skew
change the postion of the html tag based on x and y deg

scale
can change to a new position
either the size can be increased or decreased

transition
u are changing from one state to another state by specifying the duration
2 things we have to set in transition
which css property you want to add an effect to
the duration of the effect


column-count : which will display the text into multiple column output


javascript
it is a scripting language which uses java syntax
it is weakly typed scripting language because we cannot use primitive data types like int, float, double , char, string
it is useful for validating the html pages on the client side
it will make the html pages interactive

javascript can be created as an external file with .js extension 
and it can be referred in html file using <script> 

external.js
in my html , it is referred using
<script src="external.js">
</script>
we can create javascript as an internal script within html file itself
java script code is written inside the <script> tag
<script > can be written in <head> or the <body> tag of html page

1. variables are created using var
var name='Pandey';
var email="pan@gmail.com';
var age=34;
var pi=3.14;

string, char value can be given in '' or ""
2. to take input from user 
prompt()
html form elements
3. display output on the browser window
alert() ->popup window with the result/output
document.write()-> write the o/p in <body> section of the html document
4. if--else, switch -- case, while, do---while, for
5. Arrays -> multiple values
arrays are homogeneous array
hetrogeneous array
var cities=['new delhi','bengaluru','mumbai','kolkatta','chennai'];
var emp=[1,'Akshatha','F','09/03/1995',7890,'P1',2344234,true];
6. inbuilt objects
var d=new Date() -> current date/time
document -> html document ->it is a inbuilt document object
7. events
mouse event
  mouse enter
  mouse leaving
  click
key board
  keypress
  keyrelease 
  key typed
document
  load
  submit
  unload
8. functions -> can return value, can take parameters , it can be a void function also
c#
int add(int x,int y)
{
return(x+y);
}  

javascript
function add(x,y)
{
return (x+y);
}

C#
void add()
{
Console.WriteLine("Hello");
}
 
javascript
function add()
{
document.write("Hello");
}
9. validate the HTML pages
DOM Manipulation
Document object model
Entire html is a document for javascript
we will validate every element of html form using javascript 
javascript + html = client side
