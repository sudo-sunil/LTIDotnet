ASP.NET MVC
client side code -> run on the browser
server side code -> interact with the DB


client side ->html (UI)
                        angular(UI)
                    interactive and do validations
   Javascript , Jquery , Typescript


client side cannot interact with the DB directly

server side code which will interact with the DB
asp.net MVC
Model  - shape of data
class and its fields are called shape of data as per MVC
eg: employee->ename, empid, salary, dept, desg, skillsets
book -> title, author, publisher,price, catrgory,isbn(book id)
View   -> UI is designed
Controller->we write the logic of dealing with the data
insert , update, delete , select 

is a framework created by microsoft to design a web application
Registration form                 Login Form -> View 

Name,password, email, address,mobno -> model

code to register a new user in DB -> controller

MVC -> model , view and controller are folders
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


features of asp.net mvc
1. supports razor scripts
razor scripts are combination of C# and html
razor script will have an extension .cshtml

ASP.NET MVC application is inbuilt with Razor Engine
Razor engine is used to execute Razor script

Razor is a simple programming syntax for embedding server code in the web pages

asp.net razor engine supports 2 languages
csharp                           vb.net
cs+html -> .cshtml       vb+html-> .vbhtml

main rules for razor syntax
razor code is enclosed in @{ ....
                                             } block
if we want a single razor statement -> @ (inline expressions)
every executable code ends with ;
variable are declared using datatypes of .net
@{
int age=34;
string name="Geeta";
string email="deepa977@gmail.com";


}
var result=add(67,78);
C# code is case sensitive


2 . HTML Helpers
they are superset of html tags
they are used with razor syntax


server side code -> web server
asp.net mvc application -> inbuilt web server which is a part of .net framework installation is called IISExpress
Internet information server

eg: apache tomcat (java / php)
       java web server
     A web server is a server software or a system to accept the http request and execute the server side code and send the o/p received to the client side on the browser

Angular -> client side application -> connect to server side code written in WebAPI
creating these types of application is called SPA (single page application)
It is compabitable with any type of devices

if my client side code is React / Angular/ Node which is based on Javascript library, those application are called as SPA


Asp.net MVC -> web application using MVC pattern

View -> UI (cshtml)
Controller -> code for server side interaction
model -> define the shape of data we are going to work with

evolution
80 -> html 4( design ui)  
        to make it interactive they invented Javascript/ vbscript(FileSystemObject) to store data
90->html (UI)
       scripting languages like vbscript/javascript (dynamic)
       classic asp -> server side code and interact with DB using ADO (vb6.0 syntax)
2000 -> asp.net 
it was a event driven architecture
2 files (.aspx) -> UI ( html or asp.net server side controls)
            (.aspx.cs) -> code behind file -> write the  code to connect to DB and perform all DB operations using ADO.NEt

2012 -> asp.net mvc 
it will develop application that process request in the server 
it delivers UI in the form of view
it renders a view at server side and sends plain HTML as output  to the user

2017-2018-> SPA (angular /react )
it is a library based on javascript
it will not do any server side processing
it will serve only html and javascript files on client side
it will get only server side data thru services(webapi) that run on the server

html                                                                                   html helpers
<input type="text" name="txtname" id="txtname">    @Html.TextBox("txtname")
<textarea name="txtaddress">                                       @Html.TextArea("txtaddr")	<input type="radio" value="M" name="gender">       @Html.RadioButton("gender","M")
<input type="checkbox" name="" value="">	@Html.CheckBox("quali","BE")
<select name="ddlnation">                                                                @Html.DropDownList("ddlnation",new 
<option value="IN">India</option>                 List<SelectedListItem>{new SelectedListItem{Text="India",Value="IN"},new SelectedListItem{Text="America",Value="US"})
<input type="submit">
<input type="reset">

designing view in MVC project 
it supports both html helpers as well as html tags


1.asp.net mvc application
1. model 
2.views 
3.controller 
these 3 are folders in an MVC project

2. controller classes follows a naming conventions
we can give any class name but it will end with the keyword controller

HomeController.cs
AccountsController.cs
LoginController.cs

which of these are valid controller names
1.Home
2.ControllerHome
3.HomeController

3. controller will contain methods
C# methods defined
public int MethodName(parameter)

Controller methods are called action methods
controller methods will not return void or any primitive datatype
they return ActionResult which actually return a view

 Controller -> ActionResult -> View
the action methods in controller has to be public 

4. for every action we have to write 2 methods

Actions are identified by attributes 
attributes are predefined classes in C# which will convey a special meaning to the compiler
attributes can be given before a class, before a method, before a property
they are enclosed in []
[HttpGet] - default
is a get action
get will load a blank page and takes input from user
[HttpPost]
is a post action
send the data to the server for processing

Folders in MVC Project
AppData -> localdb willbe stored in App_Data
AppStart ->RouteConfig.cs  -> routing is defined in asp.net mvc project
app-routing-module.ts -> angular 
Model-shape of data 
Controllers -> will contain the get /post action  methods
Views -> UI
global.asax ->global variables are defined in global.asax which can be accessed by any controller or views of the current project
Packages.config -> any 3rd party packages we are using in the project will be configured in this file
web.config->we can configure connection _string , app_settings 

program.cs
class obj=new class();
obj.methodname();

the o/p of the method is displayed in the console

in mvc we are calling a method
where is the o/p of the method displayed? it is displayed in the view
what does these methods return -> return View()

how does the action method known which is the view associated with it?
the action method and the view have the same name

<form> -> the submit and reset button will work
in html helpers -> @using(Html.BeginForm())
{
}

Entity Framework
it is a technology used by .net applications to interact with DB
? ado.net
Features of ADO.NET
it is a combination of OOps language and SQL Server
SqlCommand -> class
SqlCommand cmd=new SqlCommand("insert into employees values("+eid + "',"+name +"','"+dept+"','"+desg+"',"+sal+")",con);
the developer has to mix the sql code with C# code
the above statement is it 100% oops?
why not have DB connectivity also 100% oops oriented
Java -> ORM (object relational mapper)
DB  -> mapped -> class
tables-> mapped ->class
views->mapped -> class
columns(tables/views)->mapped->property
stored proc-> mapped -> function
first ORM -> java-> Hibernate
ORM ->.nET-> Entity Framework

Entity framework supports 3 approaches

DB First Approach
Code First Approach -(tues)
Model First Approach-(tues)

sql -> select 
           from 
            where 
            group by
            having
            order by

Linq->from
           where
           select 
LINQ -> query language
Lambda -> Expression Language

EF -> coding is easier for developers compared to ADO.NET
1. no need to establish connection
2.no need to give sql queries directly
3. no need to load the providers
   
     DB First approach
(insert/select)
in this approach the DB is already created , we have to map the DB into Conceptual model

Conceptual model is created from the existing DB
to map the storage model to conceptual model
in the .net mvc project
right click model -> add-new item->data->ado.net entity data model

in the connection string for entity framework it will point to 2 files
csdl-conceptual storage data layer ->conceptual model
ssdl-storage storagemodel data layer -> storage model

Entity framework follows a naming convention when creating mapping classes
DB                    Conceptual class name
LTIMVC                LTIMVCEntities
Master	            MasterEntities
Temp                    TempEntities
DemoDB                DemoDBEntities

in EF (Entity Framework) we have to create tables with PK
otherwise it will give validation errors

when form is loading in the browser, u want it be loaded with Data from DB
the code has to be written in get action


return View()  ->it returns a blank view

return View(data)-> it returns a view with data

IEnumerable<Employee> obj=new List<Employee>();
only collections implementing IEnumerable can use foreach loop to retrieve the data

2 ways to link pages
1st approach is we can redirection in controller
return RedirectToAction("actionmethod","controller name")
controller name is required if the action method belonged to a different controller
2nd approach we can redirect in views
@Html.ActionLink("Link Text","Action Methodname","controller name")
controller name is required if the action method belonged to a different controller
  						                                    	If we want the web page to render data when the page is loading , then we need to write the code in get methods

if we want to retreive data from db (select) but based on parameters
select * from employee where dept= textbox && salary > textbox

Get -> textbox -> input of data
  submit button
post -> send the filters and retreive data based on the filters from the db

Login page ->
username 
password ->get

post ->based on the user credientials it will the validate the password in the DB

data has to passed from controller to view
data retreived from DB is done in controller but the display of that data will be done in view
Statemanagement techniques in MVC
model binding
return View(data)
in the view @model List<Employee>

Session ->it will hold the values for a time limit
time limit -> login and logout
if we are idle for 3 to 4 minutes and do not do any activity on the website then the data will become null and session will expire
Session["variablename"]=value;
this is the syntax for creating session variable
the data type of session variable is object datatype
session variables require typecasting


Session["age"]=32;
int age=(int)Session["age"];

1. <form> -> it will work for get 
<form method="post">

2. If the parameter for the post method is not model data, it is primitve data types
except for string , rest all datatype has to be made as optional parameter
optional parameter in C# -> (int age=32, decimal salary=10000)

3. Query String -> pass the parameter along with the URL
passing the URL Parameter is called Query String
<a href="filename" target="_self">
href, target are html attributes
if we r not specifying any attributes , define as null

EmpID    Name
1               XYZ
 1             ABC
2                EFG
3             MNO
  

EmpId=10 -> 1 , XYZ
when search is based on primary key and we are sure only 1 row of data it will retreive , we need not use foreach loop to iterate
so we use SingleOrDefault()
if data is found return the single row
if data is not found return default ->null
if there are repeating data , it will throw an exception
 
FirstOrDefault() - 1,XYZ

LastOrDefault()- 1, ABC


When ever the view has a submit button, then in controller we have to write the Get method as well as post method

ViewBag

ViewData

TempData

Assignment for today
1. select product based on category
take input of category and display all products belonging to that category
perform edit and delete of products using UrlParameter


Assignment for WeekEnd

Web project of LTI do it in MVC
create a registration table as per the fields
But have RegID as Primary Key identity
create login and check if login credentials are valid in the DB table
DB should be thru EF DB First Approach

send me the changed DB to my mail ID deepa977@gmail.com
