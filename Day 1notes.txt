Introduction to Web Technology
HTML4 /HTML 5


web application will execute on the browser
some applications like ecommerce sites, flight booking, bus booking, railways, net banking

It uses HTTP Protocol for communication
client side / server side
client side -> execute on the browser
server side -> it will execute at the web server side and send the o/p or results on the browser side

client side-> design the web page using HTML
check for empty or null values -> it should be validated at browser level itself
Jquery/ Javascript
validating the correct username/password will be done at server side -> it will check in DB
This is done using server side language called asp.net mvc, webapi
this code will reside on the web server
Webserver used is IIS (Internet information server) which will have mvc, webapi pages. MVC and webapi code is written in C# and they will interact with the DB

HTML
hypertext markup language
it is used to design web pages
it will give a static web page
it cannot do any validation or it cannot make the web pages interactive

markup <>-> it is called as tags
entire html is made up of tags
html does not belong to any company
they belong to w3c -> world wide web consoritium
consoritium -> group of companies have joined together and given the HTML standard

HTML 4.01 and HTML 5
HTML describes the structure for the web page
HTML files are saved with .htm or .html extension
HTML is not case sensitive
the tags can be written in uppercase, lower case or mixed case
every opening tag has a closing tag
the attribute values are in quotes

HTML 4.01
<html>
<head><title>My first web application</title></head>
<body>
the web page content is designed in <body> tag
</body>
</html>

text formatting tags of html
<strong> -> display text in bold
<i>-display text in italics
<u>-display text as underline
<b>-display text in bold
<br> -> new line (C# \n)
<hr>-> it will draw a horizontal line
heading tags
<h1> -> biggest font
..

<h6>- smallest of font
<p> -> define a paragraph
<div> -> it is a container tag in which we can define other tags also
div is used to divide the browser window into multiple divisions
<span> -> it is like a placeholder
we can place other tags or we can use it for display result or error message

display data as list of item
<ol> ordered list. order list can display the list as 
Uppercase alphabetic order type="A"
Lowercase alphabetic order type="a"
roman number upper case type="I"
roman number lower case type="i"
numbers type="1"


<li>->is used to display list of item

<ul> unordered list will display list of items as a bullet 
<li> - is used to display list of item
the ol and ul can be nested
---------------------
display data as table format
rows and columns
it will not validate the number of columns with the number of row data
create a table <table>
create a new row <tr>
create a new column <th>
create a row data <td>

<table border="1">

</table>

place images on the web page
<img src="filename" width="200" height="200">
how to navigate from one web page to another

<a href="html filename" target="_self">NavText</a>
target="_blank" - it will open in new browser tab
target="_self" - it will open in same browser tab
it is called as anchor tag

to navigate from one page to another page we call it as hyperlink in html

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

form elements of HTML 4
single line text box-><input type="text">
multiple line textbox <textarea rows="15" cols="15">
password field <input type="password">
radio button <input type="radio" value="">
checkbox <input type="checkbox"
radio button can select 1 item only from the list of items given
checkbox can select multiple items from the list of items given
upload a file <input type="file">
combo box or drop downlist <select>
                                                     <option> -> is used to give list of items
3 types of button
<input type="button"> - click operation ( java script /jquery)
<input type="submit"> - click operation but it will post data to server side(asp.net mvc)
<input type="reset"> -cancel or it will reset all form values

HTML5
html5 is a next major revision of the HTML 
it is a superset of HTML 4.01
HTML 5 is a cooperation between w3c(world wide web consoritum) and WHATWG(web hypertext application technology working group)

HTML 5 is supported in latest browsers . the old browser does not support HTML 5

every browser has an inbuilt s/w called parser which will execute the HTML tags and give the output

Only the latest browser supports the latest parser which can execute both HTML 4/HTML 5 tags
HTML5 can work on devices browser like ipad, iphone and android phones
 latest browser are compatible with HTML4/HTML 5 tagsader

New Features of HTML 5
new semantic tags gives better structure for the document



<section>- Generic tag which defines the application section
eg:<header section>
<content section>
<footer section>


<article> :-content like blog entry, newspaper article

<aside>: align the content to left or right of the page
It will not be a main content

<header>:header for the page

<footer>:footer section and can contain author, copyright info etc
<nav> :it will contain links to navigate to other pages
<dialog>: this tag will be used to markup a conversation
<figure>:when we upload a video,image or media element, if want to associate a caption we use <figure>

semantic tags will clearly describe its meaning both to developer and the browser
It will also not hold any data

<form> ->says we are designing an UI form
<table> ->we are giving data as rows / cols
<header> ->header data
<nav> ->navigate from one page to another

The tags which tells nothing about its contents are non semantic tags

<div> ->can div clearly tell its content
<span>
eg:
<div>-non semantic
  <h1> ->semantic
</div>

<div>
<header>
<h1></h1>
</header>
</div>

2. Form2.0 
new attributes are introduced for the <input> tag
type="color" -> allow to choose a color 
type="date"->calendar control
type="datetime" ->date and time
type="datetime-local" ->date , time, AM/PM
type="month" ->Feb, 2002 -> it will display calendar of Feb 2002
type="week" -> 34,2012->it will highlight the dates of 34th week in 2012 year
type="email" -> it will accept input in email format
type="url" -> it will accept input in url format
type="number"->we can enter only numbers
type="range" -> set a range of value min=1 max=5
type="time"-> display time with AM/PM
type="search" -> it will search the results like google search 

3. Storage is used to store user/client data using storage
by using HTML 5 and javascript
   Session Storage - will hold the data till we close the browser window
   Local Storage - will hold the data forever

to store client side data (username/password) we use cookies
cookies are created using asp.net, jsp, servlets (server side code)

4.canvas is used for drawing 2d geometric diagrams like line, rect, oval , shadow text, highlighted text
5. audio and video controls : we can embed audio and video controls without 3rd party controls 
common files supported for audio and video
ogg files
mp4
mp3

6. Geolocation:it helps to share our physical location thru the web application
7. drag items from one location and drop to another location within the same web page

new semantic tags
audio / video
form 2.0

geolocation, storage, canvas and drag and drop ( when learning javascript and jquery we will take these examples)
